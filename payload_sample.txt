{"content":{"text":"A 48-year-old obese (body mass index 36kg/m2) woman was referred to the\noutpatient clinic of a local hospital with shortness of breath and a new\nsystolic cardiac murmur detected prior to an elective spinal stenosis surgery.\nThe patient experienced chest pain in addition to increasing dyspnoea during the\nlast 12months and was found to be in NYHA functional class 2. The patient\npresented with a normal clinical examination except for moderate oedema of the\nlower extremities and a cardiac murmur, described as a grade 3 holosystolic\nmurmur above the aortic and pulmonal ostium with no diastolic components.\n\nInvestigations\n\nAn ECG was performed which was normal, and the initial TTE examination\ndemonstrated normal LV and RV systolic function, mild dilatation of the RV and\nestimated RV systolic pressure of 75mm Hg with severe dilation of the inferior\nvena cava suggestive of severe pulmonary hypertension. As a consequence, the\npatient was further examined with a lung function test that demonstrated reduced\nrestrictive lung function with an FEViof 2.8L (99%), forced vital capacity\n(FVC) of 3.3L (100%), Tiffeneau Index 85%. As a consequence of symptoms and\necho findings, pulmonary embolism was suspected, and a thoracic CT scan and a\npulmonary ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy were performed; both examinations\nwere interpreted as normal although the CT scan corroborated the echo findings\ndemonstrating a severe dilated inferior vena cava and mild dilatation of the RV.\nPulmonary function was further examined with a T1CO 121%, total lung capacity\n100% and a saturation of 95% with no possible explanation for the suspected\npulmonary hypertension.\n\nThe patient was referred to our centre for a right-heart catherisation that\nconfirmed moderate pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary pressure of 67/27mm\nHg (mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 42mm Hg) with no reversibility on\nnitrous oxide inhalation. Central venous pressure (10mm Hg), pulmonary\ncapillary wedge pressure (14mm Hg) and pulmonary resistance (1.9 Woods Units)\nwere normal. The cardiac output was severely elevated at 14.5 L/min. Arterial\nblood gasses were analysed for oxygen saturation from the aorta (96%), pulmonary\nartery (86%), right ventricle (87%), right atrium (84%), inferior vena cava\n(88%) and superior vena cava (70%), and as a consequence a left-right shunt was\nsuspected. The patient was re-evaluated with a TTE with agitated saline infusion\nwith no signs of a cardiac right-left shunting. The previous CT scan was re-\nexamined, and an arteriovenous fistula was suspected, thought to be the\nconsequence of a previous cholecystectomy performed in 2006. The patient\nunderwent angiography that demonstrated a large shunt between the right common\niliac artery and vein.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe fistula was treated under local anaesthesia with the use of two preclosure\nProGlide (Abbott) devices. A Medtronic stent graft with a diameter of 16x13x82\nmm was deployed, and control angiography showed a successfully closed fistula.\nOutcome and follow-up\n\nThe patients was examined 6months after the procedure and demonstrated no signs\n\nof heart failure, normalisation of pulmonary blood pressure (34/10mm Hg) and\ncomplete resolution of symptoms.\n"}}

His cardiovascular history\nincluded several previous percutaneous coronary interventions for ST-elevated MI\nand old MI to the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries,\nrespectively. Echocardiography showed hypokinesis of the posterolateral and\nantero-septal walls and no basal thinning of the ventricular septum. No\nsignificant coronary artery stenosis was detected during the emergency coronary\nangiography. CMR showed hypokinesis in antero-septal, antero-apical, and\nposterolateral walls with subendocardial DE corresponding with the coronary tree\nof previous MI. Additionally, mid-wall DE was confirmed in the basal-anterior\nwall with high intensity on a black-blood T2 weighted image. Subsequent FDG-PET\nimaging demonstrated high uptake in the basal-anterior wall. The patient was\nsuccessfully diagnosed with CS using combined imaging modalities despite\noverlapping previous MI. The patient was treated with corticosteroids; the focal\nhigh uptake on FDG-PET was improved and had a better clinical course without\nfurther cardiac events.\n"

            "text": "A 35-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of polysubstance abuse\n(methamphetamine, marijuana, and cocaine), presented with cardiogenic shock SCAI\nstage D, INTERMACS 1 profile. He was not responding to dual inotropic therapy\nwith escalating requirements of milrinone and dobutamine. The decision was made\nto implant an HM3 LVAD. At the time of HM3 implant, pathology of the left\nventricular apical core specimen showed a marked increase in subepicardial\nadipose tissue and focal contraction-band necrosis most consistent with\nidiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. His postoperative course was unremarkable.\n\nAfter initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy and abstinence from\nfurther drug use, he presented to the emergency room 9 months later with\nasymptomatic low flow alarms of < 1 L/min at 5500 rotations per minute (RPM).\nTransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a well-seated HM3 device and inflow\ncannula, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% to 45%, a 4.6-cm LV\nend-diastolic diameter, and notable opening of the aortic valve with each beat.\nThere were no suction events, arrythmias, nor evidence of hemolysis or pump\nthrombosis (lactate dehydrogenase 213 U/L). There was no evidence of end-organ\ndamage with normal creatinine (0.78 mg/dL) and liver function tests (bilirubin\n0.6 mg/dL, AST 24 U/L, ALT 52 U/L); international normalized ratio was\ntherapeutic (2.8), and the patient had New York Heart Association class 1\ncomplaints. A ramp study was performed, slowly decreasing the speed from 5500\nRPM to 4000 RPM, with peak exercise to 8.6 metabolic equivalents being achieved.\nLV recovery was concluded, and he was deemed a candidate for explantation.\n\nSurgical Technique and Procedure\n\nA left anterolateral thoracotomy at the sixth interspace was performed. LV\nfunction was assessed without cardiopulmonary bypass and the LVAD off, and the\npatient continued to be appropriate for explantation. Peripheral cannulation was\ndone and cardiopulmonary bypass commenced. A plug was made using a rolled\npolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt, which was sewn into a 20-mm collagen-\nimpregnated Hemashield Platinum woven double velour polyester graft (Maquet,\nGetinge Group). Next, a 20-mm pericardial patch was sewn to one end of the\ntubular graft using 4-0 prolene. A 20-mm circular opening was made within a PTFE\nfelt ring, approximately 15 mm in width, and sewn into the tubular graft 1 cm\naway from the pericardial patch end. A second identical felt ring was attached\nto the first ring using bio-glue as a sealant. The HM3 pump, bend relief, and\ndriveline were exposed. On cardiopulmonary bypass, the device was turned off,\nthe outflow graft stapled, the driveline cut, and the pump removed. The\npreviously described skirted synthetic plug was inserted into the ventriculotomy\ncore and fixed onto the sewing ring using 3-0 prolene. The patient was separated\nfrom cardiopulmonary bypass successfully with stable hemodynamics.\n\nA postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated the residual LVAD\nfixation ring with the hemostatic synthetic plug present and without any notable\nLV thrombus. The patient had an uneventful hospital course; systemic heparin was\ninitiated on postoperative day 2, and the patient was discharged on\npostoperative day 6 with an LVEF of 50% on TTE. Anticoagulation was continued\nfor 6 months after explantation without any notable sequelae. Guideline-directed\nmedical therapy ensued postoperatively. A TTE obtained 15 months after explant\nshowed that the LV apical function appeared recovered. LV systolic function was\nmoderately decreased, EF was 35% to 39%, and there was grade I mild diastolic\ndysfunction. The LV cavity was normal in size, with a 5.3-cm LV internal\ndimension, moderate global hypokinesis, and no regional contraction\nabnormalities. These echocardiography findings were also similarly unchanged at\n2 years post-explant. Currently, there is no consensus on anticoagulation post-\nLVAD explantation. Since LV wall motion, including the apex, appeared preserved,\nwe decided not to anticoagulate beyond 6 months.\n"

Her past medical history\nwas unremarkable for cardiac disease and included childhood\ntuberculosis, bronchial asthma, and partial thyroidectomy due to\ngoitre. Physical examination revealed extensive rales in the lung\nbases, and a continuous, grade 4/6 murmur all over the\npericardium and lower left sternum that radiated to the left\naxilla and had a maximum intensity over the mitral area. No\nperipheral oedema was found; functional status was New York Heart\nAssociation IIIterminal proproBNP) level (1763 pg/mL). Chest\nXdiastolic diameters of 65 and 42 mm and endnormal left\nventricular inflow (E/A: 1.33/0.81), and moderate tricuspid\nregurgitation with elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure\n(PASP) (47 + 8 = 55 mmHg). 2D and 3D TTE images suggested\ncoronary aneurysm with significant leftright shunt (Qp/Qs:\n2.159). Cardiac MRI was performed after the initiation of routine\nheart failure therapy (angiotensinblocker, and loopresolution\nblackenhanced T1 weighted images verified vessel origin and blood\nflow in the anomaly; however, the exact origin and termination\nsite could not be determined. CTA showed no signs of significant\natherosclerotic coronary artery disease (calcium score: 21) but\nrevealed an aneurysmal enlargement of the circumferential artery\nwith a maximal diameter of 3converting enzyme inhibitor dose\ntitration to 50% and betaexistence of mitral valve regurgitation.\nCardiopulmonary bypass was applied with standard aortic and\nbicaval cannulation, moderate systemic hypothermia, and a single\ndose of anterograde cold blood cardioplegia. The mitral valve was\nexplored through a transseptal incision extending to the roof of\nthe left atrium. Considerable annular dilatation was detected\nwithout significant disorder of the leaflets or subvalvular\napparatus. A 34 mmrigid annuloplasty ring was used for repair. To\naccess the inflow of the arteriovenous shunt, the main pulmonary\nartery was completely transected, and the fistula was ligated\njust distal to the LCX orifice. At the end of the first\npostoperative week, the patient developed atrial fibrillation\nwith normal ventricular rate. Amiodarone therapy was started to\nrestore and maintain sinus rhythm. Five days after successful\ncardioversion, the patient developed atrial flutter with highly\nvariable conduction rates and symptoms of presyncope. Following\nredegree atrioventricular block developed. Temporary pacing was\nnot required, and after withdrawal of betabrady syndrome;\ntherefore, a DDDrecommended optimal medical therapy. 6 , 7 Her\npreproBNP (968 pg/mL) .\n\nAt 18 months of followdiastolic diameter: 55 mm; endtosided\nchamber sizes with a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion\n(TAPSE) of 18 mm and an estimated PASP of 35 mmHg.

            "text": "A 55-year-old male patient was diagnosed with type A aortic dissection and\ndisruption of the RCA. The patient was taken to the operating theatre in stable\ncondition and without neurological deficits. Before initiation of a\ncardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the patient went into ventricular fibrillation and\nwas successfully defibrillated with a single shock. Under deep hypothermic\ncirculatory arrest with selective antegrade cerebral perfusion, we performed a\nDavid operation with replacement of the ascending aorta, the hemiarch, and\nantegrade TEVAR. Due to a tear of the right coronary ostium, a venous CABG to\nthe posterior descending artery was performed (flow 14 mL/min, pulsatility index\n6). Consecutively, the patient went into acute RHF; wherefore, a second venous\nbypass graft to the main right coronary artery was implanted (flow 28 mL/min,\npulsatility index 4.7). Since RHF persisted with severely reduced RV function\ndespite of inhaled nitric oxide (20 ppm), and inhalation of iloprost,\nadrenaline, norepinephrine, and milrinone, an Impella RPÃÂ® device was implanted\nX-ray guided by our cardiologists, and the patient was weaned from CPB\n(crossclamp time: 190 min, CPB: 346 min, CVP 12 mmHg, pH 7.12, lactate 7.4,\nnorepinephrine 10 y/min, adrenaline 10 y/min, nitric oxide 20 ppm, iloprost 20\nmcg) and transferred to the ICU. Under cautious reduction of medical cardiac\nsupport and under TEE surveillance, the patient could be weaned from Impella RPÃÂ®\non the fourth post-operative day (cardiac index: 3.6 L/min/m2, CVP: 12 mmHg,\nmoderately reduced RV function). Arterial lactate peaked peri-operatively\n(before Impella: 8.7 mmol/L, after weaning: ÃÂ©.8 mmol/L) and lactate\ndehydrogenase levels (613 U/L, after weaning: 433 U/L) and high sensitive\nTroponin-T levels (4673 ng/L, after weaning 1358 ng/L) on the first post-\noperative day. The patient was extubated on the sixth post-operative day and\ntransferred to the ward on the ninth post-operative day. Echocardiography\nrevealed a moderately impaired right ventricular function (TAM: 10 mm) and a\nmildly impaired left ventricular function. After 16 days, the patient was\ndischarged to a cardiac rehabilitation unit. At the 1 year follow-up, the\npatient presented in good condition with a mildly impaired right ventricular\nfunction.\n"
